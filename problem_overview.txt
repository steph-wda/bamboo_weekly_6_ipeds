Our data for this week comes from the US Department of Education, which tracks a huge number of data points regarding universities — both the institutions and their students — in a program they call IPEDS, short for Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System. From the IPEDS site (https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds), you can select and retrieve a wide variety of information.

I chose to retrieve, from the Digest of Education Statistics, a table showing the total number of students majoring in each of 30 different areas of study. You can view the table at https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d21/tables/dt21_322.10.asp. Better yet, you can download the file from:

https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d21/tables/xls/tabn322.10.xls

Our questions for this week are:
1.	Retrieve the Excel file with selected years, and turn it into a data frame.
2.	Remove the line numbering the surveys. Remove the total. And remove the lines at the bottom, after "Other and not classified".
3.	Remove the \n\ markings (for footnotes) from the "Field of study" column
4.	Remove newlines and other extraneous whitespace from the "Field of study" column
5.	Set the "Field of study" column to be the index.
6.	Which majors have had the greatest *increase* since the survey began in 1970-1971?
7.	Display the numbers with a comma before every three digits -- so that instead of showing "1000" it shows "1,000"
8.	Which majors have had the greatest *decrease* since the survey began in 1970-1971?
9.	If we only look at the last 10 years of the study (i.e., starting in 2010-11), do we see similar changes in majors?
10.	What percentage decline do we see in all fields containing the word "art," "language," "history," or "culture" in their names in the last 10 years?

The learning goals for this week are include cleaning unwanted rows, cleaning string data, selecting columns, and working with axes.
